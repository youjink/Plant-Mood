                It is well known that the only people more proud of their Irish heritage than the Irish are the Americans of Irish descent. New York’s St. Patrick’s Day Parade, for example, proudly traces its lineage all the way back to March 17, 1762, 14 years before the Declaration of Independence. Kelly green, one name given to the spring-grass color so many wear on St. Patrick’s Day, is a rather recent invention, emerging only at the beginning of the twentieth century. Kelly green has to do with St. Patrick. Everything known about the saint comes from the man himself: during his lifetime in the fifth century he wrote his Confessio, an account of his life in Latin, the first text written in Ireland to have survived. It begins simply: “My name is Patrick. I am a sinner, a simple country person, and the least of all believers.”

                <p>
                    The island of St. Helena lies like a lost seed in the middle of the Atlantic, 1,200 miles
                    west of Africa and 2,500 miles east of South America. It is so remote that
                    it has, for the majority of its history, been uninhabited, serving only as a
                    stop-off for ships to collect fresh water and repair their hulls. It was here
                    that the British decreed that Napoleon should be sent in October 1815
                    after his defeat at Waterloo. And it was here too that he died, six years
                    later. Although his physician had initially suspected stomach cancer,
                    when Napoleon’s body was exhumed in 1840 it was found to be curiously
                    well preserved, a symptom of arsenic poisoning. A sample of his hair,
                    tested in the twentieth century, was also found to contain abnormally
                    high levels of the poison. Once it was discovered in the 1980s that the
                    walls of his damp little room in St. Helena were papered with a verdant
                    design containing Scheele’s green, the rumor spread that the British had
                    poisoned their difficult prisoner.

                            Absinthe was made from a combination of plants and aromatics, including wormwood, aniseed, fennel, and wild marjoram, which were first bruised and then soaked in alcohol and distilled, creating a bitter, pear-colored liqueur. Ancient Greeks and Romans had used similar recipes as an insect repellent and antiseptic. The modern version was also intended for medicinal use. Pierre Ordinaire, a well-known French physician living in Switzerland just after the French Revolution, created a take on the ancient recipe as a tonic for his patients. It became commercially available at the turn of the century, but was still largely considered medicinal: French soldiers serving in Africa were given it to help ward off malaria.

                            It was Shakespeare who cemented the relationship between green and envy. With
                            The Merchant of Venice, written in the late 1590s, he gave us “green-eyed
                            jealousy”; in Othello (1603), he has Iago mention “the green-ey’d
                            monster, which doth mock / The meat it feeds on.” Prior to this, during
                            the Middle Ages, when each deadly sin had a corresponding color, green
                            had been twinned with avarice and yellow with envy.
                            Both human failings were the guiding principles in a recent saga concerning a vast green stone, the Bahia emerald.
                            Emeralds are a rare and fragile member of the beryl family, stained
                            green with small deposits of the elements chromium or vanadium. The
                            best-known sources are in Pakistan, India, Zambia, and parts of South
                            America. Ancient Egyptians mined the gemstones from 1500 B.C., setting
                            them in amulets and talismans, and they have been coveted ever since.

                             <p>  
                                Reading treatises and manuals by early artists, it is hard not to think that they often
                                faced a Sisyphean struggle to create works of lasting beauty. Pigments
                                were often mercurial, reacting badly with other pigments or changing color over time, like verdigris; they were downright lethal, like
                                orpiment and lead white; or they were ludicrously expensive
                                and difficult to acquire, like ultramarine. It could be assumed,
                                then, that if a pigment were found that was inexpensive, relatively
                                plentiful, completely stable, and in a color where there were very few
                                other options, that this pigment would be in high demand. The case of
                                terre verte shows this is not the case.
                                
                                Also known as green earth or Verona green, terre verte is a rather
                                mongrel collection of naturally occurring pigmented earths of varying
                                hues and mineral makeups. The green coloring agents are usually
                                glauconite and celadonite, but can also include many other minerals.
                                The
                                pigments crop up in great quantities in various locations throughout
                                Europe, most famously Cyprus and Verona, and come in a range of
                                colors, from deep forest, to an almost crocodilian shade, and even a
                                rather beautiful sea mist. The drawback is their low tinting strength, but
                                they are all very permanent and stable, rather transparent, work perfectly
                                in all mediums, give a peculiar, almost buttery texture to oils, and,
                                crucially, were some of the few green pigments readily available. And yet,
                                when artists write about terre verte, their words have the air of a school
                                report about a child who means well but is totally devoid of charm.

                      <p>    
                        The two had always been linked, of course—the
                        ancient Egyptian hieroglyph for “green” was a papyrus stalk—but during
                        the 1970s the link became ubiquitous.
                        A small organization called the
                        Don’t Make a Wave Committee changed its name to Greenpeace in 1972.
                        PEOPLE, the forerunner to the British Green Party, was founded in 1973;
                        Germany’s equivalent, Die Grünen, in 1979; and France’s Les Verts were
                        consolidated in the 1980s.
                        These grand ideas and a burgeoning concern for the natural world
                        were translated into a back-to-nature palette of earthy colors: burnt
                        orange, harvest gold, and, above all, avocado. This shade, which appears
                        so dated now, dominated palettes throughout the 1970s. As shoppers
                        strove to appear sincerely concerned for the welfare of the world, the
                        furthest reaches of consumer goods—clothing, kitchen appliances, baths,
                        even cars—were colonized by this smoky yellow-green tint.
                        
                        These attempts at environmental redemption through consumption
                        may well seem hopelessly naive, but similar consumer impulses prevail
                        today. And avocado has stealthily been reprising its role since the
                        millennium. Those who doubt this need only check their Instagram feeds.
                        While few advocate for avocado-colored macramé and shag pile, the
                        Persea americana has become the poster fruit (technically it’s a singleseed berry) for a new kind of luxury consumption underpinned by the
                        concept of natural healthfulness.

                        Honoré d’Urfé led a dramatic life. He was imprisoned for his political beliefs, lived
                        much of his life as an exile in Savoy, and married his brother’s beautiful
                        widow in order to keep her fortune in the d’Urfé family. It was perhaps
                        this surfeit of intrigue that led him to write the nostalgic, meandering
                        L’Astrée. Published between 1607 and 1627, the 5,399-page and 60-book
                        pastoral comedy recounts the futile quest of Céladon, a lovelorn
                        shepherd, to win back his lover Astrée after a misunderstanding.
                        Despite
                        its prodigious length and unwieldy cast of characters, it was a hit with his
                        contemporaries. It was widely translated, circulated throughout Europe,
                        and spawned a stage play and even a fashion for dressing in sylvan green
                        à la Céladon.
                        So firmly linked was Céladon with this particular woodland-fog color
                        that the word celadon was soon used to refer to a kind of similarly hued
                        type of ceramics imported from the East. The Chinese had been making
                        celadon objects for centuries before d’Urfé’s hero sprang into being.
                        Usually grayish green—although the colors can vary enormously, from
                        blues to grays to ochers and even blacks—these ceramics are
                        characterized by the presence of iron in the clay and iron oxide,
                        manganese oxide, and quartz in the glaze.
